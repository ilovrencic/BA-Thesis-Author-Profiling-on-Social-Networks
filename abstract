Author profiling is a method of analyzing a given number of texts to try to uncover
various characteristics of the author. Profiling methods are largely based on the stylo-
metric features of the text and are therefore extremely useful in todayâ€™s world marked
by a large number of social networks. This paper deals with the determination of gen-
der, age, and intesity of psychological features of the author. The models are based
on natural language processing tools and machine learning algorithms. After the de-
velopment of gender, age and intesity of psychological features models, experimental
evaluation of the model and analysis of the obtained data was performed.
